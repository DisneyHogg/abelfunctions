`abelfunctions <http://github.com/cswiercz/abelfunctions>`_ is a Python library
for computing with complex algebraic curves, Riemann surfaces, and Abelian
functions. If this is your first time using abelfunctions then I suggest you
begin with the :doc:`quick_tutorial`. See :doc:`reference/index` for a list
of common functions as well as a complete reference to the source code.
