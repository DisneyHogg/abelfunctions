Abelfunctions is a [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org) library for computing with Abelian functions, Riemann surfaces, and algebraic curves. If you are new to Abelfunctions, begin with the [Getting Started](https://github.com/abelfunctions/abelfunctions/blob/master/doc/GettingStarted.md) guide. More tutorials, application areas, and complete software reference is presented in the documentation below.
