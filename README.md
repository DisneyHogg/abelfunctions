Abelfunctions
=============

> **Notice:** I am in the process of rewriting Abelfunctions to use Sage (www.sagemath.org) exclusively. This is a large undertaking but will vastly improve the performance and range of problems the software can solve. The primary motivation behind this rewrite is due to Sympy's minimal support for computing over number fields. (In particular, the lacking `RootOf` construct.) See [Issue #83](https://github.com/cswiercz/abelfunctions/issues/83) for additional motivation behind this rewrite.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cswiercz/abelfunctions.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cswiercz/abelfunctions)

A library for computing with Abelian functions, Riemann surfaces, and algebraic
curves. Abelfunctions is the Ph.D thesis work of Chris Swierczewski. Please see
the [Documentation](http://abelfunctions.cswiercz.info) for more information.

> **Warning:** Abelfunctions is still in active development. Any issues should
  be reported to the [Issues
  Page](https://github.com/cswiercz/abelfunctions/issues) of the project or you
  can contact Chris Swierczewski directly at <cswiercz@gmail.com>.
